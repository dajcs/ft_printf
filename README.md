# ft_printf

ft_printf project @ 42 school

- in directory `./mandatory` is the basic part
- in directory `.test` is a `main.c` test that expects 2 arguments: the `format` string and the variable to be printed
- currently in the repository root the first part of the bonus is implemented, handling of `-`, `0`, `.`, precision and width.
- the second part of the bonus is not done.
